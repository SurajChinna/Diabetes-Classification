<h1>Project Name:</h1>
Diabetes Classification using KNN and Logistic Regression.
<h2>About Project:</h2>
<p>
  The project is about classifying whether the patient has Diabetes or not based on various categories like pregnancies the patient has had, 
  their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on. The model is built on KNN and Logistic Regression and Logistic Regression gives a good
  accuracy than KNN, which is nearly 81%.<br/>
  The dataset has no null values but there are zero values for some features which are not acceptible. So the data has to be cleaned
  and then processed for training on machine learning models.
